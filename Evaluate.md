## Positives
- The project folders are well organized which make it easy to search.
- The scene scene hierarchy is clear and easy to debug.

## Nagatives and Suggestions
- Instead of three player prefabs, the better way is to make them variants of a single prefab. 
When configurations are needed, only the original prefab has to be modified. Same goes for the Obstacle prefabs.
- When spawning Obstacles in the scene, they can be group under the same parent to better organize the hierarchy.
- Some Game objects in the scene can be make into prefabs. This can prevent scene conflict.
